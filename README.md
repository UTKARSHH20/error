## TreeHacks 2025: 2nd Place in Best Use of ElevenLabs

## Inspiration  
We were motivated by the power of **rubber duck debugging** and the wisdom of Richard Feynman’s quote:  
> *"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."*  

Too often, AI is used to give answers, but **true learning happens when we explain concepts ourselves**. We wanted to flip AI on its head. Rather than asking the duck for answers, **you teach it**, and it pushes back with evaluations, scores, and follow-up questions to deepen your understanding.  

## What it does  
**The Duck You Mean** is an interactive web app that lets users pick a topic and engage in a back-and-forth conversation where **AI plays the role of a curious student**. Users must explain concepts, and the AI:  
- **Scores their explanations** based on clarity, correctness, and depth  
- **Asks intelligent follow-up questions** to test deeper understanding  
- **Provides feedback** to refine and strengthen their knowledge  

We also created zone called "The Pond", where users can create Zoom Meetings to study with friends or chill out after completing a lesson.


## Featured APIs
-**ElevenLabs** - facilitates the full conversation process from user mic input to duck voice generation

-**Zoom API** - creates meetings for peer-to-peer study sessions

-**OpenAI API** - generates the starting question based on the prompt, 

-**Mistrel AI** - supports topic ideation and question formation

-**Luma AI** - powers duck thoughts through created images

## Challenges we ran into  
- **Fine-tuning AI’s response evaluation**—balancing depth of feedback while keeping interactions engaging  
- **Generating meaningful follow-up questions** without redundancy  
- **Integrating voice interactions smoothly** for an immersive experience  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
- Successfully **flipped AI’s role** from answering questions to **being the student**  
- Developed an engaging **voice-driven AI tutor experience**  
- Created an **effective learning tool** that enforces deeper understanding  
- Seamlessly integrated multiple AI-powered services  

## What we learned  
- Teaching a concept **cements learning better than passive studying**  
- Thoughtful follow-up questions **are key to uncovering misunderstandings**  
- **Conversational AI** can enhance education beyond just answering queries

## What's next for The Duck You Mean?  
- **Learning History** to intelligently track user progress over time
- **Gamification:** Achievements, streaks, and leaderboards  
- **Mobile app version** to promote learning on the go
